Hello! I'm `hyperlynx`, a freelance software developer with skills in Java, C++, Rust, Python, and a few other languages. 

I also am a big fan of modding Minecraft. I maintain my main project, [Reactive Alchemy](https://github.com/hjake123/reactive), and am currently developing other projects as well, to be released Someday. I also work with Streavant Studios, run by [GatoDev](https://gato.dev/) to make small-scale mods on a commission basis. If you have a small mod you're thinking of having commissioned, feel free to reach out to me with the contact info below!

If you happen to be here from my resume, welcome! I would love to get in touch and discuss any oppotunities you have in mind.
